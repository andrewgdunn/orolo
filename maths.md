## SymPy
[SymPy](http://www.sympygamma.com)
is a Python library for symbolic mathematical computations. It has a broad
range of features, ranging from calculus, algebra, geometry, discrete
mathematics, and even quantum physics. It also includes basic plotting
functionality and print functions with LaTeX support.

## SciPy
[SciPy](http://scipy.org)
is a considered to be one of the core packages for scientific computing
routines. As a useful expansion of the NumPy core functionality, it contains a
broad range of functions for linear algebra, interpolation, integration,
clustering, and [many more](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/index.html).

## NumPy
[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org)
is probably the most fundamental package for efficient scientific
computing in Python through linear algebra routines. One of NumPy's major
strength is that most operations are implemented as C/C++ and FORTRAN code for
efficiency. At its core, NumPy works with multi-dimensional array objects that
support broadcasting and lead to efficient, vectorized code.

## Theano
[Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano)
is an optimizing GPU-meta-programming code generating array oriented optimizing
math compiler in Python
