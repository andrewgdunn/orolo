# Technology

## Simpy
[simpy](https://simpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
is a process-based discrete-event simulation framework based on standard Python.
Its event dispatcher is based on Pythonâ€™s generators and can also be used for
asynchronous networking or to implement multi-agent systems (with both,
simulated and real communication).

## nifi
[nifi](https://nifi.apache.org/)
supports powerful and scalable directed graphs of data routing, transformation, and system mediation logic.
