## Scientific Computing

### IPython
[IPython](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)
is an alternative Python command line shell for interactive computing
with lots of useful enhancements over the "default" Python interpreter.

The browser-based documents IPython Notebooks are a great environment for
scientific computing: Not only to execute code, but also to add informative
documentation via Markdown, HTML, LaTeX, embedded images, and in-line data plots
via e.g., matplotlib.

### SciPy
[SciPy](http://scipy.org)
is a considered to be one of the core packages for scientific computing
routines. As a useful expansion of the NumPy core functionality, it contains a
broad range of functions for linear algebra, interpolation, integration,
clustering, and [many more](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/index.html).

### NumPy
[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org)
is probably the most fundamental package for efficient scientific
computing in Python through linear algebra routines. One of NumPy's major
strength is that most operations are implemented as C/C++ and FORTRAN code for
efficiency. At its core, NumPy works with multi-dimensional array objects that
support broadcasting and lead to efficient, vectorized code.

### Pandas
[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
is a library for operating with table-like structures. It comes with a
powerful DataFrame object, which is a multi-dimensional array object for
efficient numerical operations similar to NumPy's *ndarray* with additional
functionalities.

### Blaze
[Blaze](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/blaze)
extends the usability of NumPy and Pandas to distributed and out-of-core
computing. Blaze provides an interface similar to that of the NumPy ND-Array or
Pandas DataFrame but maps these familiar interfaces onto a variety of other
computational engines like Postgres or Spark.

### Theano
[Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano)
is an optimizing GPU-meta-programming code generating array oriented optimizing
math compiler in Python


## Maths

### SymPy
[SymPy](http://www.sympygamma.com)
is a Python library for symbolic mathematical computations. It has a broad
range of features, ranging from calculus, algebra, geometry, discrete
mathematics, and even quantum physics. It also includes basic plotting
functionality and print functions with LaTeX support.

## Statistics

### statsmodels
[statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net)
is a Python library that is centered around statistical data
analysis mainly through linear models and includes a variety of statistical tests.

### Patsy
[Patsy](https://github.com/pydata/patsy)
is a Python library for describing statistical models (especially linear
models, or models that have a linear component) and building design matrices.
Patsy brings the convenience of R "formulas" to Python.

### kcbo
[kcbo](https://github.com/HHammond/kcbo)
is a Bayesian testing framework written in Python.

## Image Processing

### Pillow
[Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow)
is the "friendly" PIL fork by Alex Clark and Contributors. PIL is the Python
Imaging Library by Fredrik Lundh and Contributors.

### Scikit-image
[Scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/)
is a collection of algorithms for image processing. It is available
free of charge and free of restriction.
