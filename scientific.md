## IPython
[IPython](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)
is an alternative Python command line shell for interactive computing
with lots of useful enhancements over the "default" Python interpreter.

The browser-based documents IPython Notebooks are a great environment for
scientific computing: Not only to execute code, but also to add informative
documentation via Markdown, HTML, LaTeX, embedded images, and in-line data plots
via e.g., matplotlib.

## Jupyter
[jupyter](https://jupyter.org)
is a web-based interactive computing platform that allows users to author data-
and code-driven narratives that combine live code, equations, narrative text,
visualizations, interactive dashboards and other media.
