Fraa Orolo is a Decenarian Fraa from the Concent of Saunt Edhar. He is an
eminent cosmographer and Erasmas's mentor at the concent, but he's later
thrown back for using forbidden technology to observe the Geometers in violation
of the Discipline's isolation requirements. - [Anathem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anathem)

This repository is an an attempt at responding to my natural desire to collect
information on new praxis and technology. There are a plethora of wonderful
artifacts and projects being shared with society, in this collection of files I
attempt to come up with a nomenclature to remember them.

The name choice is a reference to being 'thrown back' for the use of forbidden
technology. In many workplaces one doesn't usually have the choice of technology
for a given task. When there are these imposed limitations it is likely that one
would fall significantly short of the task potential. My hope is to catalog both
technologies and associated praxis so that I, and maybe others, have a quick
references when taking on a new task.

It's important to catalog both the praxis and technology, many times one will
stumble into a tool-set because they are scratching the surface of applying new
praxis.

Before the list, here are some anecdotes that I've really enjoyed finding:

[The Zen of Python](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)

    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

[Composable & Contextual, Dietzler's Law for Access](http://nealford.com/memeagora/2013/01/22/why_everyone_eventually_hates_maven.html)

    Every Access project will eventually fail because, while 80% of what the
    user wants is fast and easy to create, and the next 10% is possible with
    difficulty, ultimately the last 10% is impossible because you canâ€™t get far
    enough underneath the built-in abstractions, and users always want 100% of
    what they want.
