# Technology

### Pandas
[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
is a library for operating with table-like structures. It comes with a
powerful DataFrame object, which is a multi-dimensional array object for
efficient numerical operations similar to NumPy's *ndarray* with additional
functionalities.

### Blaze
[Blaze](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/blaze)
extends the usability of NumPy and Pandas to distributed and out-of-core
computing. Blaze provides an interface similar to that of the NumPy ND-Array or
Pandas DataFrame but maps these familiar interfaces onto a variety of other
computational engines like Postgres or Spark.

### scrapy
[scrapy](http://scrapy.org/)
is an open source and collaborative framework for extracting the data you need
from websites. In a fast, simple, yet extensible way.

### pattern
[pattern](https://github.com/clips/pattern)
is a web mining module for Python. It has tools for:

 - Data Mining: web services (Google, Twitter, Wikipedia), web crawler, HTML DOM parser
 - Natural Language Processing: part-of-speech taggers, n-gram search, sentiment analysis, WordNet
 - Machine Learning: vector space model, clustering, classification (KNN, SVM, Perceptron)
 - Network Analysis: graph centrality and visualization.


### dragline
[dragline](https://github.com/inzyte/dragline)
is a distributed python web crawling framework.

### sqlitebrowser
[sqlitebrowser](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser)
is a high quality, visual, open source tool to create, design, and edit database
files compatible with SQLite

### dtcleaner
[dtcleaner](https://github.com/AmmsA/DTCleaner)
produces multi-target decision trees for the purpose of data cleaning. It's
built for detecting erroneous tuples in the dataset based on given set of
conditional functional dependencies (CFDs) and building a classification model
to predict erroneous tuples such that the "cleaned" dataset satisfies the CFDs,
and semantically correct.

## Analysis

### cubes
[cubes](http://cubes.databrewery.org/)
Light-weight Python framework and OLAP HTTP server for easy development of reporting applications and aggregate browsing of multi-dimensionally modeled data.

### mondrian
[mondrian](http://community.pentaho.com/projects/mondrian/)
Online Analytical Processing server (OLAP). Allows business users to analyze large and complex amounts of 
data in real-time.
