## Data

### Pandas
[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
is a library for operating with table-like structures. It comes with a
powerful DataFrame object, which is a multi-dimensional array object for
efficient numerical operations similar to NumPy's *ndarray* with additional
functionalities.

### Blaze
[Blaze](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/blaze)
extends the usability of NumPy and Pandas to distributed and out-of-core
computing. Blaze provides an interface similar to that of the NumPy ND-Array or
Pandas DataFrame but maps these familiar interfaces onto a variety of other
computational engines like Postgres or Spark.
