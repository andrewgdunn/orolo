# Technology

## Python
[Python](https://www.python.org/)
is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design
philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to
express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages
such as C. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs
on both a small and large scale. The standard library has extensive support for
complex data structures and I/O through standard formats and protocols. As of
January 2014, the Python Package Index, the official repository of third-party
software for Python, contains more than 38,000 packages.

### doctest
[doctest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctest)
is a module included in the Python programming language's standard library that
allows the easy generation of tests based on output from the standard Python
interpreter shell, cut and pasted into docstrings.

## Julia
[Julia](http://julialang.org/)
is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical
computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing
environments. It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel
execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library.
Julia is an ambitious language. It aims to be as fast as C, as easy to use as
Python, and as statistically inclined as R (to name a few goals).

## R
[R](http://www.r-project.org/)
is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. The
language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing
statistical software and data analysis.

The capabilities of R are extended through user-created packages, which allow
specialized statistical techniques, graphical devices (ggplot2), import/export
capabilities, reporting tools (knitr, Sweave), etc. These packages are developed
primarily in R, and sometimes in Java, C and Fortran. A core set of packages is
included with the installation of R, with more than 5,800 additional packages
and 120,000 functions (as of June 2014) available at the Comprehensive R Archive
Network (CRAN), Bioconductor, and other repositories.
