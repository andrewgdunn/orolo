# Technology

## Scikit-learn
[Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
is is probably the most popular general machine library for Python.
It includes a broad range of different classifiers, cross-validation and other
model selection methods, dimensionality reduction techniques, modules for
regression and clustering analysis, and a useful data-preprocessing module.

## Shogun
[Shogun](https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun)
is a machine learning library that is focused on large-scale kernel
methods. Its particular strengths are Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and it
comes with a range of different SVM implementations.

## PyBrain
[PyBrain](http://pybrain.org)
(Python-Based Reinforcement Learning, Artificial Intelligence and
Neural Network Library) is a machine learning library that uses neural networks
to focus on supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and evolutionary methods.

## PyLearn2
[PyLearn2](https://github.com/lisa-lab/pylearn2)
is a machine learning **research** library - a library to study machine
learning - focused on deep and convolution neural networks, restricted Boltzman
machines, and auto-encoders.

## PyMC
[PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc)
is a python module for Bayesian statistical modeling and model fitting
which focuses on advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo fitting algorithms. Its
flexibility and extensibility make it applicable to a large suite of problems.

## inspyred
[inspyred](https://github.com/aarongarrett/inspyred)
is a free, open source framework for creating biologically-inspired
computational intelligence algorithms in Python, including evolutionary
computation, swarm intelligence, and immunocomputing. Additionally, inspyred
provides easy-to-use canonical versions of many bio-inspired algorithms for
users who don't need much customization.

## MOE
[MOE](https://github.com/Yelp/MOE)
Metric Optimization Engine. A global, black box optimization engine for real
world metric optimization.
