## ZeroMQ
[ZerMQ](http://zeromq.org/)
is a high-performance asynchronous messaging library aimed at use in scalable
distributed or concurrent applications. It provides a message queue, but unlike
message-oriented middleware, a Ã˜MQ system can run without a dedicated message
broker. The library is designed to have a familiar socket-style API.
